## Adding the repo
Before you can install our cogs, you need to add our repo to your instance so it can find, our cogs by name. To do so, run the following command:

When you run this command, Red may give you a warning about installing third party cogs. If you're presented with this, you'll need to respond in chat with "I agree".
